## TABLE OF CONTENT </br>

We divided our project into several sections: </br></br>
[**CONSTRAINTS**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/constraints.md)
</br> Here you can find our group rules. </br>

</br> Our members have their own fulltime job/student. In this page we explained
about our availability timetable. Avaialability to work as a group, studying

[**USER PERSONA**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/user-personas.md)
</br> In this section we creating an imaginary targeted audience in order to
think using their point of view. The imaginary audience comes with their

We picked and filtered their needs by categories; Must have, Should have, Could
have. </br>

User persona done! Backlog done! Now we have their needs and priority! We use
all of it as a base to design our website or _wireframe_. </br>
[**DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/development-strategy.md)</br>
This section is based on backlog. A breakdown or explanation of our wireframe.
