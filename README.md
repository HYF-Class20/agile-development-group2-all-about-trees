# ALL ABOUT TREES

WELCOME TO ALL ABOUT TREES! </br> A collaborating project to learn and practice
Agile Developments in a realtime with trees as our theme. </br> We are creating
a comprehensive database of information on trees from around the world. </br>
Our goal is to provide a resource for students, researchers and anyone
interested in learning more about the many different species of trees that
exist.</br> </br> </br>

## TABLE OF CONTENT </br>

We divided our project into several sections: </br>
[**CONSTRAINTS**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/constraints.md)
</br> Here you can find our group rules. </br>
[**COMMUNICATIONS**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/communication.md)
</br> Our members have their own fulltime job/student. In this page we explained
about our availability timetable. Avaialability to work as a group, studying
duration, meeting schedules, and so on. </br>
[**USER PERSONA**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/user-personas.md)
</br> In this section we creating an imaginary targeted audience in order to
think using their point of view. The imaginary audience comes with their
interest in trees searching a way to find solution of their frustration to
explaining people about trees and their important role in this nature. </br>
[**BACKLOG**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/backlog.md)
After creating user persona we can move forward thinking as the way they think.
We picked and filtered their needs by categories; Must have, Should have, Could
have. </br>
[**DESIGN**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/design.md)
User persona done! Backlog done! Now we have their needs and priority! We use
all of it as a base to design our website or _wireframe_. </br>
[**DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/development-strategy.md)
This section is based on backlog. A breakdown or explanation of our wireframe.
</br>
[**RETROSPECTIVE**](https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees/blob/master/planning/retrospective.md)
</br> A summary of intern feedback </br></br>

## Technologies

- Node 19.8.1
- VSC code
- Oh my zsh
- ...
- ...

## Setup

## Step 1

- Open the repo you want to clone
- Click `code`
- Copy the HTTPS link
- Open the terminal on your computer
- `pwd` -> to know on which path are you working now
- `cd desktop` -> to work on desktop
- `mkdir agile-group2`-> to create a new directory/folder called
  **agile-group2**
- `cd agile-group2`-> to work in folder **agile-group2**
- `git clone <the link you copied from github repo>` </br> in our case the
  command gonna be
  `git clone https://github.com/HYF-Class20/agile-development-group2-all-about-trees`

## Step 2

- Go to VSCode
- Open your repo
- `git pull` to get the newest version of master repo
- `git checkout -b <branch name>` to work out of master repo and creating a new
  branch. </br> Example `git checkout -b add-home-page` with this command you're
  out of master repo, creating a branch called **add-home-page** and work inside
  that branch. </br> **!!NEVER WORK INSIDE MASTER REPO!! NEVER CHANGE ANYTHING
  IN THE MASTER!! ALWAYS WORK IN BRANCH!!**
- `npm i` -> to install npm. You need this for linting!
- Work inside folder `planning`
- Do your task
- Once your task is done, you run `git status` -> to see what changes you've
  made
- `git add <name of the files you've changes>` this command is to add your
  spesific changes. </br> **IT'S NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE `git add .`**
- `git status` to see the changes you've made
- No red message on git status, all green.
- `git commit -m "<meaningful message>"`

## Step 3

Linting! </br> This step is to check your code quality. Your code MUST passed
the check. Except the result for command `npm run spell-check` you can ignore.

Linting command :

- `npm run format`
- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run spell-check`
- `npm run lint:ls`
- `npm run lint:md`
- If all of them passed then you can push the code
- `git push origin <your branch name>`
